## Introduction

Point cloud computation has become an increasingly more important workload for autonomous driving and other applications. Unlike dense 2D computation, point cloud convolution has **sparse** and **irregular** computation patterns and thus requires dedicated inference system support with specialized high-performance kernels. While existing point cloud deep learning libraries have developed different dataflows for convolution on point clouds, they assume a single dataflow throughout the execution of the entire model. In this work, we systematically analyze and improve existing dataflows. Our resulting system, TorchSparse, achieves **2.9x**, **3.3x**, **2.2x** and **1.7x** measured end-to-end speedup on an NVIDIA A100 GPU over the state-of-the-art MinkowskiEngine, SpConv 1.2, TorchSparse (MLSys) and SpConv v2 in inference respectively. 

## Installation

### Installation for CUDA12+ (New!)

Tested with CU121, CU126 on A100, H100.
Minor modification for the recent CUDA syntax.

#### Prerequisites 
```bash
# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update

# (optional) core C/C++ build tools and C library headers
sudo apt-get install --reinstall build-essential libc6-dev

# (optional) Install Google's sparsehash library required by the source code
sudo apt-get install libsparsehash-dev

# (Set Environment Variables) specify the include paths:
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include:/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu
```

#### Prebuilt wheel (only cu121, cp310 & cp311)
```bash
# py3.11/torch2.5.1+cu121 
pip install https://github.com/hwanhuh/torchsparse/releases/download/v2.1.0-linux-cu121/torchsparse-2.1.0-cp311-cp311-linux_x86_64.whl

# py3.10/torch2.5.1.+cu121
pip install https://github.com/hwanhuh/torchsparse/releases/download/v2.1.0-linux-cu121/torchsparse-2.1.0-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl
```

#### from source 

- Option A: Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hwanhuh/torchsparse.git
cd torchsparse
pip install .
```

- Option B: Install Directly from GitHub

```
pip install git+https://github.com/hwanhuh/torchsparse.git
```

- highly recommended for the compilation speed up

```bash
export TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="Your/Arch/Version" #e.g. 8.0 
export MAX_JOBS=64 #Adjust to the number of CPU cores available
```

without the need to clone the repository. 

## Benchmarks

### Inference benchmarks

![eval_benchmark.png](./docs/figs/eval_benchmark.png)

TorchSparse significantly outperforms existing point cloud inference engines in both 3D object detection and LiDAR segmentation benchmarks across three generations of GPU architecture (Pascal, Turing and Ampere)  and all precisions (FP16, TF32, FP32). It is up to **1.7x** faster than state-of-the-art SpConv 2.3.5 and is up to **2.2x** faster than  
TorchSparse-MLsys on cloud GPUs. It also improves the latency of SpConv 2.3.5 by **1.25Ã—** on Orin.

### Training benchmarks

![train_benchmark.png](./docs/figs/train_benchmark.png)

TorchSparse achieves superior mixed-precision training speed compared with MinkowskiEngine, TorchSparse-MLSys and SpConv 2.3.5. Specifically, it is **1.16x** faster on Tesla A100, **1.27x** faster on RTX 2080 Ti than state-of-the-art SpConv 2.3.5. It also significantly outperforms MinkowskiEngine by **4.6-4.8x** across seven benchmarks on A100 and 2080 Ti. Measured with batch size = 2.
